          Shi came to the Netherlands from China with her parents in 2015. As Christians they were no longer safe and
          had to flee. Shi is currently active at the Worldhouse (Wereldhuis), a place where people without a valid
          residence permit can go to receive support and meet other people.

          We asked Shi a few questions so you can get to know her a little better.
        </div>
        <p>
          <b>Q:</b> What do you like to do in your spare time? <br>
          <b>A:</b> I like doing crafts like knitting and crocheting. For example, I recently made a hat for my father.
          Now I knit socks with a rabbit on them, I love rabbits!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Q:</b> What do you miss most about China?<br>
          <b>A:</b> I miss the food, especially the snacks. In very warm weather, such as last summer, I enjoyed eating
          the ice-cold soup 'Four Fruit Soup': it contains bubbles (those from bubble tea), lotus seed, the so-called
          ‘Vibrant fungus’ (a type of special fungus), pineapple and other fruits such as mango or melon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Q:</b> What does your morning look like?<br>
          <b>A:</b> I get up, then my two rabbits are waiting for me and I feed them kibble. Then I wake myself up a bit
          with a cup of coffee. I always take a quiet moment to read the Bible. Currently, I am reading the book of 1
          Peter. Then my day begins.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Q:</b> Suppose you can invite three people to a dinner that you are organizing. Who would you like to have
          at your table?<br>
          <b>A:</b> I would invite my parents and my boyfriend. Those three people mean the most to me right now.

        <p>
          I grew up in a rural village in Fujian Province, China. In 2015, I came to the Netherlands at the age of
          eighteen, together with my parents. When I was ten years old, I converted to the Christian faith. As a child I
          always suffered from anxiety and often had the feeling that there were evil spirits around me. I had no peace
          and was afraid of being alone. My mother once said to me: 'If you are afraid, you can pray to Jesus, and He
          will protect you.' I tried prayer, and felt peace and tranquility come over me, and since then I believed. My
          inner peace was more important than the danger in the outside world, which was increasing for my parents and
          me.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <img src="images/quote-border.svg" alt="">
          <p> We are the only ones in our extended family who are Christian, and we often felt left out. </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Officially, practicing Christianity is allowed by Chinese law. But the practice is different than in the
          Netherlands. There are 'registered churches' where everything that is read, sung, prayed and said is
          controlled by the government. As someone from a registered church, you must obey the Party first, and then
          obey God. But for my family that is no longer faith. God comes first.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are the only ones in our extended family who are Christian, and we often felt left out. During family
          visits, we were often stopped at the door frame and met with: ‘If you promise not to talk about God, you can
          come in.’ Even as a child I felt their disapproval.
          Luckily we had our church. We met underground in brothers' or sisters' homes, often changing meeting places,
          singing in whispers and praying silently, for fear that someone would hear us. There were cameras everywhere –
          anyone could be a spy. At the same time, we wanted to preach the gospel to others.

          But one day a good friend of my mother was arrested. We heard that the police probably had CCTV footage of her
          regular visits to our house. That same week, my father, who worked for the government, was told by his
          manager: 'You are on the blacklist. I want to protect you, but then you have to report six others to the
          police.' My father agreed, but only to buy time. In the meantime, we quickly packed our suitcases. We couldn't
          stay there anymore.

        <blockquote>
          <img src="images/quote-border.svg" alt="">
          <p>The conclusion was that we were not Christians. According to the IND our experiences of faith were too
            general, too superficial, and too vague.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          But where were we supposed to go? We were in panic. Soon they would be at our door! We prayed to the Lord day
          and night. Then my mother had a dream of lawns, cows, a mill. She didn't know what this meant, but my father
          recognized it as a message: we were going to the Netherlands. We paid a lot of money through a travel agency
          to obtain the correct documentation. Not long after my mother's friend was arrested, we fled China. We’ve
          never returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Netherlands we went to the asylum seeker centers in Ter Apel. To be recognized as refugees, we had to
          prove two things to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND): that we were Christians and therefore in
          serious danger in our home country of China. And that meant showing evidence and documentation, such as
          confirmation that we were part of the church. But that posed a problem: we had no official documents, videos,
          or other form of evidence. After all, our church was underground and was designed to not be discovered. We
          were also asked questions such as: 'What does Jesus mean to you?'. We tried to answer this as personally as
          possible, to no avail: the conclusion was that we were not Christians. According to the IND our experiences of
          faith were too general, too superficial, and too vague, and therefore we were not in danger and had to return
          to China. That was a big blow: we did not dare to be who we are in China, and we are not recognized for who we
          are in the Netherlands.

        <p>
          We have been living illegally and ‘undocumented’ since our asylum applications were rejected in the
          Netherlands. I have no valid ID, no 'papers': I cannot study, work officially, or register anywhere. I cannot
          collect packages as an ID is required. I consciously don't go to 16+ films – I wouldn't be able to get in
          there either. I do not exist for the Dutch state.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the state knows that me and my family are still here. We are not actively being deported. But as soon
          as we come into contact with the police somewhere, we run the risk of being deported back to China. But we
          don't dare turn back: as soon as we set foot on the Chinese airport, we will probably be arrested. We have
          therefore cut off all contact with our family and friends there so as not to put them in danger.

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I am grateful for the religious freedom I have in the Netherlands. We have a church in The Hague where we can
          sing out loud, form a community, be ourselves. At the same time, my life feels like I'm standing in a tiny
          room, surrounded by four walls without windows: I can take a few steps forward and back, but I never get far.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could study one day, I would like to learn more about healthcare: both physical and mental care. In my
          volunteer work at the Wereldhuis I encounter people who are physically ill, sometimes very ill, but do not
          want or dare to go to a doctor because they are afraid that it would be dangerous and could be a burden to
          others. These people often do not speak Dutch or English, do not know how the healthcare system works, cannot
          find an interpreter, have no idea which doctor they are allowed to go to without running the risk of being
          arrested by the police.

          I don't see very big differences between the Dutch and the Chinese. We are all just people. Something I
          noticed from the start was the different meaning we give to the word 'no': in China, saying no once is not
          really a 'no'. 'Would you like a cup of tea?', 'No, thank you', is often followed by two more: 'Oh, have a
          cup!'. In the Netherlands, once 'no' usually means 'no'. I have learned to say no when necessary. This is
          still a bit difficult when asking for help. I often say that I don't need help. Now I think I have learned to
          be more honest with my opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I think I have learned to be more honest with my opinions.
          I don't look too far into the future. I live day by day, but with hope: I will not lose that. I seek to live
          as normal a life as possible, within the space I do have. I hope that one day I will legally be allowed to
          stay in the Netherlands.

            Public discourse around migration continues to be polarised in the Netherlands. On both ends of the
            spectrum, immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers are often spoken about in mainstream media, with resulting
            stories maintaining an us/her divide. MYgration seeks to bridge this divide through providing a space where
            people can share migratory stories in her own words and on her own terms. In doing so, MYgration offers a
            multi-dimensional portrait of the ‘migrant experience’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please help us share these stories in any way you can. Together we can improve my society's understanding of
            migration and the people involved.
