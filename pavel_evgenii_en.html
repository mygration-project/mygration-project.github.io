        <div class="section-des">
          Pavel and Evgenii came to the Netherlands in 2018. They fled their home country Russia after threats from the
          Russian government regarding their gay marriage. After living in Asylum Seeker Centers for 6 months, they
          received a residence permit and home in Nijmegen. Pavel works as a doctor at a mental health clinic, after
          completing his entire medical studies in Dutch. Evgenii works as a case manager at a social institution in
          Nijmegen. Both plan to stay in the Netherlands.
        </div>

        <div class="section-des">
          We asked Pavel and Evgenii a few questions so you can get to know them a little better.
        </div>
        <p>
          <b>Q: Imagine you're having a dinner party, and you can invite anyone. Who would you invite? </b><br>
          <b>Evgenii:</b> Anna Pavlovna. She was a Russian woman married to a Dutch king who lived in the Netherlands in
          the 18th century. They say her Dutch was better than her Russian. I would like to know what she thought of the
          Netherlands at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Q: What do you like to do in your spare time? </b><br>
          <b>Pavel:</b> I collect LEGO. We have them on display in our living room. <br>
          <b>Evgenii:</b> I collect perfumes, especially perfumes with a history. At the moment I am wearing 'Curir de
          l'Aigle Russe' by Orzal Legrad.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Q: What would you still like to learn? </b><br>
          <b>Evgenii:</b> I'm learning German. Some people might not agree with me [Laughs], but I really like the sound
          of the language. Of course, I am constantly working to improve my Dutch.

        <h2 class="title">Read Pavel and Evgenii's story</h2>
        <p>
          It started with our love. We lived together in an apartment in Moscow, on the 9th floor. We both studied
          medicine. Hardly anyone knew about our relationship – not even our parents – just a handful of very good
          friends. The neighbor once asked us suspiciously what our relationship actually was. Why did we share an
          apartment? We told him we were brothers: that's safer than saying you're friends.
        </p>

        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        <blockquote>
          <img src="images/quote-border.svg" alt="">
          <p>We had experienced hostility and threats before, so we had to be careful. Yet we trusted that the Russian
            state would protect us.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Despite the risks, we decided to get married in 2018, in Denmark. We flew there for five days, completed the
          legal matters and returned to Moscow. Once we were back, it felt strange to be married without anyone knowing.
          That is why we investigated whether it was possible to have a same-sex marriage recognized in Russian law. To
          our surprise, it was possible! The municipality was obliged to recognize the international marital status from
          our passports. Suddenly we were the first gay marriage in Russia to be legally recognized. We couldn't believe
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had to share this with others. We sent a photo of our passport to friends. One promptly referred us to the
          opposition television station, called 'Dozht', which has been operating from the Netherlands since the
          invasion of Ukraine. Our TV interview attracted a lot of attention from like-minded people. We had experienced
          hostility and threats before, so we had to be careful. Yet we trusted that the Russian state would protect us.
          It couldn't get that bad, could it?
        </p>

        <div id="portfolio-wrapper" class="relative block-right">
          <div class="portfolio-load-content-holder"></div>
          <div class="grid" id="portfolio-grid">
            <div class="grid-sizer"></div>
            <div id="p-item-1" class="grid-item element-item p-one">
              <img src="images/pavel_evgenii/MYgration_PAVELEVGENII4.jpg" alt="Pavel telling a story" />
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          But it did get that bad. The Russian government dismissed our interview as 'fake news', stating that our gay
          marriage was clearly not legalized in Russia – that was impossible. That same day, some police officers
          surrounded our apartment in Moscow. They cut off our electricity and water and forbade us from leaving the
          house. We were stuck, and felt threatened and terrified. Were these really our fellow citizens, the police, to
          whom we paid taxes, who were now intimidating us?
        </p>

        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        <blockquote>
          <img src="images/quote-border.svg" alt="">
          <p>The next day our apartment was completely surrounded by police officers. We couldn't get out.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          We didn't know what to do. We called the NGO 'LGBT Network', an organization that helps people in the
          community to get out of difficult situations like ours. They sent journalists and supporters to our apartment
          to serve as witnesses to what would happen to us. The next day our apartment was completely surrounded by
          police officers. We couldn't get out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through our lawyer, we received an ultimatum that night from the head of the Moscow police: we had to
          surrender our passports and remove our marital status as spouses. If we did not do this, 'the police would no
          longer be able to guarantee our safety'. The message was painful to receive – we had lost all support from the
          institutions we once believed in. Of course, we knew about the regime's corruption. But we never expected to
          be treated as non-citizens, as outlaws, or enemies of the state.
        </p>

        <div id="portfolio-wrapper" class="relative block-right">
          <div class="portfolio-load-content-holder"></div>
          <div class="grid" id="portfolio-grid">
            <div class="grid-sizer"></div>
            <div id="p-item-1" class="grid-item element-item p-one">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          We decided to surrender our passports. Thankfully, the police left, but we no longer felt safe. That same
          night we left for the airport. We had to leave this country. Just two days earlier we thought we would spend
          our lives in Russia as doctors, and now we were forced to flee and leave behind everything – absolutely
          everything we had built.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's how we ended up in the Netherlands. We were treated better here than we could ever have expected.
          We spent our first two and a half weeks in a detention center in Schiphol, then six months in an asylum
          center. Afterwards we received a residence permit and a house in Nijmegen. We are very grateful for how we
          were treated. It helped that we started learning Dutch from day 1, which made it easier for us to connect with
          the people around us.
        </p>
        <div class="clearfix"></div>
        <blockquote>
          <img src="images/quote-border.svg" alt="">
          <p>We still miss Russia. We miss our family and friends. In particular, we miss traveling – not because we did
            it often, but precisely because we have seen so little of our enormous country.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          If there is something we might offer as advice to newcomers coming to the Netherlands, it is that you must be
          assertive here. In Russia, people are quite hierarchical: your role within the group is often already
          determined. Therefore, if you, as a student, are quiet and listen, you are 'smart'. However, if you do not
          make yourself heard in the Netherlands, you are sometimes seen as 'stupid'. People asked us during our
          studies: 'why are you so quiet?'. As a result, we have also become more assertive in recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
          We still miss Russia. We miss our family and friends. In particular, we miss traveling – not because we did it
          often, but precisely because we have seen so little of our enormous country. Now we have been to the Hermitage
          Amsterdam (now “H'ART”) with our Museum Card, but never to Saint Petersburg!
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          Funnily enough, we feel more Russian here in the Netherlands than we did in Russia. Many people here approach
          us as “storytellers” of Russian culture. They like to see us as carriers of Russia’s rich literature and music
          history, for example. And we actually think that's nice. When a friend comes to visit who we know is
          interested in the writer Dostoyevsky, we even read up a bit so we can learn more about our culture. I feel
          responsible to show both sides of Russia: the difficult and beautiful aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here in the Netherlands we can be ourselves, and live our lives the way we <i>want to</i>.

            Public discourse around migration continues to be polarised in the Netherlands. On both ends of the
            spectrum, immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers are often spoken about in mainstream media, with resulting
            stories maintaining an us/them divide. MYgration seeks to bridge this divide through providing a space where
            people can share migratory stories in their own words and on their own terms. In doing so, MYgration offers
            a multi-dimensional portrait of the ‘migrant experience’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please help us share these stories in any way you can. Together we can improve our society's understanding
            of migration and the people involved.
